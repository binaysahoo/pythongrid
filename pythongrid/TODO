TODO


- clean up TODO :)
- handle the case, where the first heart-beat is never sent
- also catch missing import exceptions when loading job file (maybe split information in two)?
- One suggestion(?) related with runJob() and runBulkJobs() is you might need to check the returned "jobid" for robustness. I've seen lots of cases where it returns non-valid jobid if actual job submission is failed, especially when there are many users using a cluster.

pre-0.3:
+ update to new DRMAA wrapper!
+ clearly document "submit and wait" and "submit and collect"

post-0.3:
+ add apply_to_combination as helper
+ Add a simle keyboard handler which allows all jobs to be killed (abort)
+ Unify method jobs, reconsider whether it makes sense to have this
+ Need a better way to set job and file names. Preferably human readable and unique.
+ Clear memory after pickling in the constructor, so reduce memory usage
+ validate member flags for KybJob
+ hold interface
+ add feature of sending out email when jobs have finished
